# Blind Scape
The following repository shows a game console made for blind people. this project was made in colaboration with Benjamin Loubies. This proyect started on a class called interface dsign. the idea came after we could sucesfully use a wii controller on Rhino 7 controling the movemnt and construction of a small procedural building, if interest in this project contact me.

Afterwards we knew we wanted to create a game console and make a game based in rhino grasshopper. finally we chose a user to give us our restictions on how we built the interface, do to the short time we had to develope and test console, we didnÂ´t have the chance o have blind people test the ergonomics of our design.

the final console had an escape room game a bluetooth controller and the main console. initially we wanted to make this console a handheld but, our profesors wanted us to make to separate objects so it's a shared expireance
