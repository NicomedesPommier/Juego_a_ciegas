# Blind Scape
The following repository showcases a game console designed for blind individuals. This project was created in collaboration with Benjamin Loubies. It originated during a class called Interface Design. The concept emerged after successfully utilizing a Wii controller in Rhino 7 to control the movement and construction of a small procedural building. If interested in this project, please contact me.

Subsequently, we decided to develop a game console and design a game based on Rhino Grasshopper. Eventually, we selected a blind user to provide us with restrictions on how to construct the interface. Due to the limited time available for development and testing of the console, we were unable to have blind individuals evaluate the ergonomics of our design.

The final console included an escape room game, a Bluetooth controller, and the main console. Initially, we aimed to create a handheld console, but our professors encouraged us to develop separate objects to enhance the shared experience.
